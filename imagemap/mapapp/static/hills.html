    <p style="font-size: x-large; font-family:  'Lucida Grande';">The Palamathi Hills (also Balamathi, Balamathi Hills) are an extension of the Eastern Ghats spread across southeastern parts of Vellore City in Tamil Nadu. The Palamathi Hill range, the nearby Palamathi Reserve Forest, and the Otteri lake are collectively referred to as Palamathi Hills. The area is a thriving hotspot for various birds and various flora. The hill top has a famous Hindu temple (Bala Murugan Kovil). The place is also a developing tourist destination.</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large; font-family:  'Lucida Grande';">Balamathi Hill, located in Vellore, is often referred to as "Vellore's Ooty" due to its pleasant and chilly weather, particularly in the early morning and post-evenings. With a height of approximately 1640 feet, this mountain range offers a refreshing environment for visitors</p>
